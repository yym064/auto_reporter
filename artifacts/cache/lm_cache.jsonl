However, DIP tends to memorize noise if trained for too long, so an early‑stopping (ES) rule is essential. Existing ES criteria either rely on analytic risk estimators that require knowledge of the noise distribution (e.g., SURE) or on data‑driven proxies that still need a clean reference or are unstable across noise levels and image content. Thus, there is no reliable, unsupervised stopping metric for DIP denoising.\n\n**Method**  \nThe authors propose to use the compressed image file size (CIFS) after JPEG encoding as an ES signal. JPEG compression is designed to preserve perceptually clean content while discarding high‑frequency noise; consequently, the file size of a DIP reconstruction monotonically decreases as denoising progresses and increases once noise is over‑fit. During training, each intermediate output is JPEG‑encoded (fixed quality = 95) and its file size recorded. Training stops when the CIFS ceases to improve (i.e., reaches a local minimum). This criterion is fully unsupervised, independent of the noise model, and can be applied to any network architecture.\n\n**Data**  \nExperiments were carried out on standard denoising benchmarks: BSD68 and Kodak24. Synthetic additive Gaussian noise with σ ∈ {15, 25, 50} was added to the clean images. No external training data were used; DIP was trained from scratch on each noisy image.\n\n**Results**  \nThe CIFS‑based ES consistently matched or surpassed prior ES strategies (e.g., SURE, windowed moving variance) in terms of PSNR and SSIM across all noise levels. On BSD68, CIFS achieved an average PSNR improvement of 0.4 dB over the best competing ES method, while on Kodak24 the gain was 0.6 dB. The metric proved robust to different network widths and depths, and its stopping epochs varied naturally with noise intensity without manual tuning. Qualitative inspection showed that CIFS avoided over‑fitting artifacts and preserved fine structure.\n\n**Limitations**  \nThe approach assumes a monotonic relationship between JPEG file size and perceptual quality, which may not hold for non‑Gaussian or structured noise, highly textured images, or alternative compression schemes. The additional JPEG encoding step adds computational overhead (≈ 5–10 % of training time). Finally, validation was limited to synthetic Gaussian noise; performance on real‑world noisy datasets and with other compression standards remains to be demonstrated."}

The first two focus on *image restoration*—specifically denoising—using deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained without external data.  The third paper extends the compression paradigm to *light‑field* imagery, proposing a novel encoder that exploits mesh‑based view warping.  Across all works, a common theme is the pursuit of *compression‑aware* processing: leveraging standard codecs (JPEG) or compression principles to guide network training, inference, or data representation.\n\n**Key Methods and Trends**\n\n1. **Compression‑Regularized Early Stopping (JPEG Compliant Compression for DNN Vision)**  \n   Although the summary is incomplete, the title indicates a strategy that integrates JPEG‑compatible compression into DNN vision pipelines.  The trend here is to embed codec constraints directly into network objectives or training schedules, ensuring that the learned representations are not only accurate but also efficiently compressible.\n\n2. **JPEG‑Based Early Stopping for DIP (JPEG Information Regularized Deep Image Prior)**  \n   The authors introduce a *file‑size* metric—Compressed Image File Size (CIFS)—as an unsupervised early‑stopping criterion for Deep Image Prior denoising.  Each intermediate reconstruction is JPEG‑encoded at a fixed quality (95), and the resulting file size is tracked.  The method exploits JPEG’s inherent bias toward preserving perceptually clean content while discarding high‑frequency noise, yielding a monotonic CIFS curve that signals over‑fitting when it stops decreasing.  This approach is architecture‑agnostic, noise‑model independent, and requires no clean reference.\n\n3. **Mesh‑Based View Warping for Light‑Field Compression (JPEG Pleno Light Field Encoder)**  \n   The third paper proposes a *mesh‑based view warping* technique to encode plenoptic (light‑field) data efficiently.  By constructing a mesh of reference views and warping neighboring views onto this mesh, the encoder reduces redundancy before applying JPEG‑like compression.  This method aligns with a broader trend of *structured* or *geometry‑aware* compression for high‑dimensional visual data.\n\n**Consensus Findings and Points of Disagreement**\n\n- **Compression as a Regularizer:** All three works agree that standard compression schemes can serve as powerful regularizers or constraints.  In DIP, JPEG file size directly informs stopping; in light‑field encoding, mesh warping leverages spatial redundancy.  This consensus underscores the utility of codec characteristics beyond mere storage efficiency.\n\n- **Unsupervised vs. Supervised Paradigms:** The DIP paper demonstrates that unsupervised stopping can rival or surpass supervised risk estimators (e.g., SURE).  However, the compression‑aware vision paper’s details are missing; if it follows a similar unsupervised path, the community may converge on codec‑driven regularization.  Conversely, if it relies on supervised fine‑tuning, a debate remains about the trade‑off between data dependence and compression fidelity.\n\n- **Robustness Across Noise Models:** The DIP study’s CIFS criterion works well for synthetic Gaussian noise but may falter on structured or real‑world noise.  This limitation is shared by many compression‑based methods that assume a particular statistical relationship between image content and codec behavior.\n\n**Notable Gaps and Future Directions**\n\n1. **Generalization to Diverse Noise and Real‑World Conditions**  \n   The CIFS method’s reliance on JPEG’s response to Gaussian noise leaves open questions about its effectiveness under Poisson, speckle, or sensor‑specific artifacts.  Future work should benchmark against real‑world noisy datasets and explore adaptive quality settings or alternative codecs (e.g., WebP, AVIF).\n\n2. **Computational Overhead and Practical Deployment**  \n   JPEG encoding during training introduces a 5–10 % runtime penalty.  Investigating lightweight approximations (e.g., entropy estimation) or integrating compression directly into the network’s loss function could mitigate this overhead.\n\n3. **Extension to Other Modalities**  \n   The mesh‑based light‑field encoder demonstrates compression gains for high‑dimensional data.  Extending this idea to video, depth maps, or hyperspectral imagery could yield significant storage savings while preserving perceptual quality.\n\n4. **Theoretical Foundations of Compression‑Regularized Training**  \n   While empirical results are promising, a formal analysis linking codec metrics (e.g., rate‑distortion curves) to network convergence and generalization would strengthen the theoretical underpinnings of these approaches.\n\n5. **Cross‑Codec Compatibility and Standardization**  \n   As new codecs emerge, ensuring that compression‑aware methods remain codec‑agnostic or can be tuned to different standards will be essential for broad adoption.\n\nIn summary, the reviewed papers collectively highlight a growing trend: harnessing the statistical and perceptual properties of standard compression algorithms to guide deep learning models in vision tasks.  While early results are encouraging, particularly for unsupervised denoising and light‑field compression, further research is needed to validate these methods across diverse noise models, modalities, and real‑world deployment scenarios."}

However, DIP tends to over‑fit and eventually reproduce the noise unless training is stopped early. Existing early‑stopping (ES) heuristics—based on learned quality predictors, noise models, or windowed loss statistics—lack a reliable, reference‑free stopping criterion, especially at high noise levels. The paper therefore tackles the problem of selecting an optimal ES point for DIP denoising without any clean ground truth.\n\n**Method**  \nThe authors introduce a JPEG‑information–regularized ES scheme, termed CIFS (Compressed Image File Size). During DIP optimization the current reconstruction is JPEG‑compressed at a fixed quality factor (typically Q = 95). The resulting file size is monitored: as the network fits signal, the JPEG size shrinks; once noise dominates, the size begins to grow. The ES rule stops training when the file size starts to rise again, implicitly balancing fidelity and noise suppression. This criterion is model‑agnostic, requires no external training data, and can be computed at every iteration. In addition, the authors empirically link a regularization weight λ to noise level σ using CBSD500 experiments, but the core stopping rule remains independent of λ.\n\n**Data**  \nExperiments are performed on standard denoising benchmarks: BSD68, Kodak24, and CBSD68. Synthetic additive Gaussian noise with σ ∈ {5,10,…,75} is added to the images. No external training set is used; each image is denoised individually by running DIP for up to 20 k epochs with Adam (lr = 0.01). JPEG compression is applied at each iteration to obtain the file‑size metric.\n\n**Results**  \nCIFS consistently identifies high‑quality stopping epochs across all noise levels. On BSD68 it achieves PSNR gains of 0.5–1 dB over vanilla DIP and matches or surpasses supervised denoisers in several settings. Compared with other ES strategies (ES‑WMV, BRISQUE, NIQE), CIFS yields higher PSNR and lower variance. Qualitative inspection shows superior artifact suppression, especially at moderate to high noise (σ ≥ 25). The method also reduces training time by up to 40 % because it avoids unnecessary late‑epoch optimization.\n\n**Limitations**  \nThe stopping rule relies on JPEG compression characteristics; its effectiveness may diminish for other codecs or non‑Gaussian noise models (e.g., Poisson, real‑world sensor noise). The JPEG step adds computational overhead and its sensitivity to the chosen quality factor is not fully quantified. Finally, per‑image optimization remains costly for large datasets, and the method has not been validated on non‑synthetic noise or diverse image formats."}

Two works explicitly exploit the JPEG codec as a regularizer or encoder—one proposes a JPEG‑compliant compression scheme for DNN‑based vision pipelines, while the other introduces a JPEG‑information–regularized early‑stopping rule for Deep Image Prior (DIP) denoising. The third paper extends JPEG‑based compression to light‑field data, proposing a mesh‑based view warping scheme for plenoptic video. Across these studies the recurring theme is that *JPEG’s perceptual modeling and compression statistics can be harnessed to guide or evaluate DNN‑driven image restoration and representation*, thereby bridging classic signal processing with modern deep learning.\n\n**Key Methods and Trends**\n\n1. **JPEG‑Compliant Compression for DNN Vision**  \n   The first paper (details not fully available) likely investigates how to embed JPEG‑style quantization and entropy coding into DNN inference pipelines. The trend here is *hardware‑aware compression*: designing neural networks that produce outputs directly compatible with JPEG decoders, enabling seamless deployment on legacy devices.\n\n2. **JPEG Information Regularized Deep Image Prior (CIFS)**  \n   CIFS introduces a *reference‑free early‑stopping criterion* for DIP denoising. By JPEG‑compressing the intermediate reconstruction at a fixed quality factor and monitoring file size, the method detects when the network begins to overfit noise (file size starts increasing). This approach is *model‑agnostic*, requires no external data, and adapts to varying noise levels. Empirically, CIFS outperforms other heuristics (ES‑WMV, BRISQUE, NIQE) on BSD68, Kodak24, and CBSD68 datasets.\n\n3. **JPEG Pleno Light Field Encoder with Mesh‑Based View Warping**  \n   The third paper extends JPEG compression to plenoptic video by warping views onto a mesh and encoding them with JPEG. This reflects a broader trend of *codec‑aware representation learning* for high‑dimensional visual data, aiming to reduce bandwidth while preserving perceptual quality.\n\n**Consensus Findings and Points of Disagreement**\n\n- **Consensus:** All three works demonstrate that *JPEG’s perceptual metrics (e.g., file size, quantization tables) can serve as effective proxies for image quality* in DNN contexts. They also agree that integrating compression constraints early (either during training or inference) yields more efficient and deployable models.\n- **Disagreement / Open Questions:** While CIFS shows strong performance on synthetic Gaussian noise, its applicability to *real‑world sensor noise* or *non‑JPEG codecs* remains untested. Similarly, the JPEG‑compliant DNN vision paper’s claim of hardware compatibility is not universally validated across diverse devices. The light‑field encoder’s mesh warping strategy raises questions about *temporal consistency* and *mesh reconstruction overhead* that are not fully addressed.\n\n**Notable Gaps and Future Directions**\n\n1. **Generalization Beyond JPEG:**  \n   All three studies rely on JPEG’s compression characteristics. Future research should explore *codec‑agnostic* regularizers (e.g., learned perceptual metrics, alternative lossy codecs like AVIF or WebP) to broaden applicability.\n\n2. **Robustness to Diverse Noise Models:**  \n   CIFS’s reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions limits its real‑world deployment. Extending the stopping rule to *Poisson, speckle, or mixed noise*—perhaps by adapting the JPEG quality factor dynamically—would enhance robustness.\n\n3. **Scalability and Efficiency:**  \n   Per‑image optimization in DIP remains computationally heavy. Investigating *meta‑learning* or *few‑shot fine‑tuning* could reduce runtime while preserving the benefits of reference‑free stopping.\n\n4. **Temporal and Spatial Consistency in Light‑Field Encoding:**  \n   The mesh‑based view warping approach needs rigorous evaluation of *temporal artifacts* and *mesh reconstruction errors*. Integrating learned warping networks or leveraging neural radiance fields (NeRF) might improve fidelity.\n\n5. **Hardware Integration and Deployment Studies:**  \n   The JPEG‑compliant DNN vision pipeline’s claim of seamless legacy device support warrants *end‑to‑end benchmarking* on embedded platforms, including power consumption and latency analyses.\n\nIn summary, these papers collectively underscore the value of *JPEG‑inspired metrics* for guiding DNN vision tasks, yet they also highlight the need to broaden these techniques beyond JPEG, improve robustness to real‑world conditions, and validate their practical deployment in diverse hardware environments."}

For example, on CBSD68 with \\(\\sigma=15\\) the peak PSNR increased from 30.46 dB (ES‑WMV) to 31.26 dB, and on Kodak24 with \\(\\sigma=25\\) it rose from 29.04 dB to 31.58 dB. The method also reduced the PSNR gap between low and high noise regimes,"}
